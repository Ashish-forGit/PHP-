## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning PHP from the ground up. I'll be starting with the basics and gradually moving to more complex topics, aiming to build a strong foundation in PHP programming. Each day, I will add new code snippets, examples, and projects to this repository.

## Daily Progress

I will document my daily progress here, including what I learned and the code I wrote.

### Day 1
- Learned about PHP syntax and basic constructs.
- Wrote a script to display "Hello, World!".

### Day 2
- Learned about variables and data types.
- Implemented a script to demonstrate variable usage and type checking.

*(And so on...)*

## Setup Instructions

To run the PHP scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Install PHP**: Make sure PHP is installed on your machine. You can download it from [php.net](https://www.php.net/downloads).
2. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ashish-forGit/php-.git
    cd php-
    ```
3. **Run the scripts**: Navigate to the directory containing the script you want to run and execute it using the PHP command:
    ```bash
    php script-name.php
    ```

## Code Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

php-learning-journey/
├── README.md
├── day1/
│ └── hello_world.php
├── day2/
│ └── variables.php
└── ...


- Each day's code will be placed in its own directory (e.g., `day1`, `day2`, etc.).
- The directory names and file names will indicate the topic or concept covered.

## Resources

Here are some resources I am using to learn PHP:

- [PHP Manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en/)
- [W3Schools PHP Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/php/)
- [PHP: The Right Way](https://phptherightway.com/)
